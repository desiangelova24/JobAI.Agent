## 🚦 How it Works

The agent follows a structured execution flow to ensure data integrity and security:

1. **Initialization:** The system greets the user via voice alerts and verifies the presence of the `appsettings.json` configuration file.
2. **Validation:** If the configuration is missing or invalid, the bot enters a smart retry loop, waiting for the user to provide the necessary credentials before proceeding.
3. **Operation:** * The bot launches the browser and performs a secure LinkedIn login.
    * It scrapes job postings based on "Remote" and "EUR" salary filters.
    * Data is sent to the **Gemini AI** engine for deep requirement analysis.
4. **Quota & Error Handling:** * If an AI API limit is reached, the system automatically cycles through backup keys.
    * It includes a built-in 35-second cooldown period to respect rate limits and ensure continuous operation.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting & Common Issues

### 🌐 1. Browser version mismatch
**Issue:** The bot fails to launch or gives a "Driver version" error.
**Solution:** Ensure your Microsoft Edge is up to date. The `EdgeDriver` should match your browser version. The program is designed to use the latest stable release.

### 🛡️ 2. LinkedIn 2FA Pop-up
**Issue:** The bot stops and asks for a code.
**Solution:** This is a security feature. Look at the console log; you will hear a voice alert. You have 120 seconds to manually enter the code from your email before the session terminates for security.

### 🔑 3. Login Failed (Invalid Credentials)
**Issue:** Automation stops at the login screen.
**Solution:** Check your `appsettings.json`. Make sure your email and password are correct and that there are no extra spaces.

### 🕒 4. Timeout Exceptions
**Issue:** The program crashes with a "TimeoutException".
**Solution:** This usually happens due to a slow internet connection. The bot is set to wait for 10 seconds for elements to appear. If your connection is slow, try increasing the wait time in `TryAutomaticLogin`.
